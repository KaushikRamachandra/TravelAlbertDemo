# TravelAlbertDemo
A demo code stuff for Travel Alberta

Demo is built on MVC5 and have used Autofac for Dependency Injection and MSTest for unit testing/parsing tests.

On the UI I have used WebEssentials for bundle and minification.
Have two pages doing what was given as requirement, one built with DataTables and another one built with kendo (MVVM) style. Both have almost the exact features and do client side filtering.

I have disabled bundling on build, if need be please do enable it.
